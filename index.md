I am a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at the Federal University of ABC, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Stefano Nardulli](http://professor.ufabc.edu.br/~stefano.nardulli/index.html), [MÃ¡rcio Fabiano da Silva](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7618767393745018), and [Paolo Piccione](https://www.ime.usp.br/~piccione/).

My primary areas of research interest include **geometric measure theory**, **geometric analysis** and **calculus of variations**. Secondary, I am interested in **stereology** and **general relativity**.
