I am a Matematics Ph.D. candidate at Federal University of ABC where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Stefano Nardulli](http://professor.ufabc.edu.br/~stefano.nardulli/index.html), [Prof. MÃ¡rcio Fabiano da Silva](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7618767393745018) and [Prof. Paolo Piccione](https://www.ime.usp.br/~piccione/).

My primary areas of research interest include **geometric measure theory**, **geometric analysis** and **calculus of variations**. Secondary, I am interested in **stereology** and **general relativity**.
