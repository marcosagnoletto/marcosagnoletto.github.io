I'm a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at Federal University of ABC, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Stefano Nardulli](http://professor.ufabc.edu.br/~stefano.nardulli/index.html), [MÃ¡rcio Fabiano da Silva](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7618767393745018), [Paolo Piccione](https://www.ime.usp.br/~piccione/), and [Reinaldo Resende](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~rresende/).

Until July 2025, I will be a visiting PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) supervised by [Reinaldo Resende](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~rresende/). From January to June 2026, I'll be at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/) in Princeton as a Visiting Student Research Collaborator (VSRC), supervised by [Camillo De Lellis](https://www.math.ias.edu/delellis/node/1).

# Research interests

- Geometric Measure Theory
- Riemannian geometry

As an undergraduate, I studied geometric probability, integral geometry and stereology in Euclidean space. Additionally, I studied the homology of surfaces and an introduction to algebraic topology. After that, my Master's dissertation was about the isoperimetric inequality in the Cartan-Hadamard manifolds and the Aubin conjecture. 

Currently, during my PhD, I am studying Allard's $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem and the regularity at the boundary of $Q$-valued functions.

For a detailed version of my curriculum, see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/CV.pdf). A detailed version of my Statement of Research Interests (SRI) is available upon request.
